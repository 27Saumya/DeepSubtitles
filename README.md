## Here's a Demo ðŸ‘€
<img src="https://j.gifs.com/57wQ8v.gif" width="400" align="center">

## What it does:

- Takes a video file's path as the input
- Generates Subtitles from the video's contents
- Renders them onto the video

Goal of this project was to provide accessibility to the video for people with disabilities.

## Features

- ðŸ’¯ Accurate subtitles, powered by [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/)
- âš¡ Customisable
- ðŸ‘€ Heavily commented and documented code

One Caveat is that it's not a fast script and probably not ideal for a production environment.
